                There are 3 categories to choose from: Films, Countries and
                Famous People.
              </li>
              <li>
                Within each category there are a total number of 18 words to
                guess in total.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the player manages to guess all 18 words without being hung,
                they win.
              </li>
              <li>
                With each new subsequent round the player is given a new word
                that is obscured from them.
              </li>
              <li>
                The player must reveal the word by guessing the correct letters,
                one at a time.
              </li>
              <li>
                The player has 10 lives, therefore, ten opportunities to guess
                the correct word.
              </li>
              <li>The player can risk 5 lives for a clue/hint.</li>
              <li>
                With each life lost, the hangman is drawn in incremental steps.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the players runs out of lives and the hangman is fully
                drawn, the game is lost.

              Tracking the inputted characters from the player, comparing them
              with the characters in the hidden word and then discerning between
              the right and wrong characters, whilst at the same time revealing
              correctly gussed characters to the player in real time was one of
              the more challenging aspects of this project.

                  The inputted characters from the user were filtered through a
                  function that would take the input as one argument.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  This inputted character was then checked against the
                  characters within the hidden word using the .includes array
                  method, which was stored as a global array variable.

                  A second function handled the functionality that would reveal
                  a correctly gussed character to the player. If a player had
                  gussed correctly, the game would have to reconstruct the
                  obscured word to now include that new character.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A .forEach method was used that would iterate through the
                  characters of the hidden word. This method would use
                  conditional statements to then check each character of the
                  hidden word array and compare them with the global array that
                  was keeping track of the correctly gussed characters.

                  replace all obscured charaters '-' in the hidden word array
                  with the correctly guessed characters.
